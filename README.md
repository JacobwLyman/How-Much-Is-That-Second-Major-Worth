# How Much is That Second Major Worth?

## Abstract:
This study examines the difference in earnings between college graduates who select to double-major for their bachelor’s degree versus those who select to only single-major. To collect a greater return on their education, students are often compelled to double-major as they pursue their bachelor’s degree. Does this decision effectively increase student outcomes? At the beginning of this study, my initial assumption was that a second major would insignificantly affect the earnings of an individual. The results of this study confirm this hypothesis, providing evidence that a second major insignificantly affects earnings at the 95% confidence level, all else held constant.
